# FEATURES

This project has a firmware for a full wireless communication system based on the ESP32-wroom-32u MCU. The system consists of two IoT devices. One has a 500KB file, this device should be configured as a TRANSMITTER and It has to send that file to a RECEIVER located 100 m away with LOS.

The TRANSMITTER is powered by a battery and it has low power features.

To establish a two-way communication between the two ESP32 boards, The system uses the ESP-NOW communication protocol. ESPNOW communication protocol has a range in open field up to 220 meters ~ 722 feet. ESP-NOW is a connectionless communication protocol developed by Espressif that features short packet transmission. This protocol enables multiple devices to talk to each other without using Wi-Fi.

This is a fast communication protocol that can be used to exchange small messages (up to 250 bytes) between ESP32 boards. ESP-NOW is very versatile and you can have one-way or two-way communication in different arrangements.

# PREREQUISITES

Before proceeding with this project, make sure you have installed the ESP32 add-on Arduino IDE, Weâ€™ll program the ESP32 using Arduino IDE, so before proceeding with this tutorial you should have the ESP32 add-on installed in your Arduino IDE.

##GETTING THE BOARDS MAC ADDRESS
To send messages between each board, we need to know their MAC address. Each board has a unique MAC address. Upload the following code to each of your boards to get their MAC address.

```cpp
#include "WiFi.h"
 
void setup(){
  Serial.begin(115200);
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_MODE_STA);
  Serial.println(WiFi.macAddress());
}
 
void loop(){
}
```
After uploading the code, press the RST button, and the MAC address should be displayed on the Serial Monitor.

#SET UP THE TRANSMITER DEVICE

Open the firmware with PLATFORM-IO. In the platform.ini file select the COM port of the transmitter device.

```
[env:esp32dev]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
upload_port = COM4
framework = arduino
```

Then, in the main.cpp file located in the src folder, you have to choose the TRANSMITTER mode by uncommenting the #define:

```cpp
#include "RadioFileTransfer.h"

#define _TRANSMITTER 1
//#define _RECEIVER 1
...

```

If you want to see the output in a serial interface uncomment the DEBUG_FILE_TRANSFER flag in the RadioFileTransfer.h header file:

```cpp
#ifndef _RADIO_FILE_TRANSFER_H_INCLUDED
#define _RADIO_FILE_TRANSFER_H_INCLUDED

#define _DEBUG_FILE_TRANSFER
	....
```
The serial port is configured to 115200 bauds.

Before powering the transmitter device, you have to insert a SD memory with a file on it named test.txt with the content you want to transmit to the receiver. Then place the SD memory on the SD card holder.


#SET UP THE RECEIVER DEVICE

For the RECEIVER, use the same firmware, but this time you have to set up the RECEIVER flag in the main.cpp file:

```cpp
#include "RadioFileTransfer.h"

//#define _TRANSMITTER 1
#define _RECEIVER 1
...

```

Also you can see the output in a serial terminal by uncommenting the DEBUG_FILE_TRANSFER flag in the RadioFileTransfer.h header file.

Before power on the device, remember to insert an SD card to save the incoming data.

The receiver device acts like a gateway. The receiver is listening all the time for incoming packets. This device should not be powered by a battery.

# RESULTS

I placed both devices at a distance of 100 meters between them, I used a file of 514460 bytes and sent little packets of 50 bytes to send the full package. I got a transmission time of 4 minutes and sent 10829 chunks. The time on air of the packets is about 3 mS.

# TO DO
- Code Refactoring in Espressif IDE.
- Perform testing & debugging to catch all the error events.
- Add external watchdog functionality.
- Create documentation.
